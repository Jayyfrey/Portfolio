				<h3>Hello! My name is Jeff</h3> 
				<p>and I am not quoting a movie! Born in California, I have lived in Arizona my whole life.</p>
				<p>I have a beautiful family, seen here. My wife Chelsie, my son Leo, and my daughter Kiera.</p>
				<p>After going from job to job most of my life, I recently decided to make a complete career change.
					I am becoming a Software Engineer thanks to Thinkful.

				<h2>History</h2>
					<p>
					I have worked for varying companies and with varying jobs. I've worked on a farm, pest control,
				 	salesman, call center, call center, and the longest career was Correctional Officer at a prison. 
					In all my jobs, I learned a lot about what I like and what I don't like. I think the biggest thing
					I learned that I don't like is working in the Arizona heat.
					</p>
					<p>
					As I worked hard in each career, my main goal was to support my family. I had dreams to work an amazing
					job to completely support them. I have several years of schooling, ranging from Biology classes to Accounting.
					However, after realizing that I can be good at just about anything I set my mind to, I decided I wanted to 
					work on coding. I started the Thinkful Program and quit my job.
					</p>
					<p>
					Although I am only beginning, these are some skills that I've learned:
					</p>
				
			<ul>
				<li>Basic HTML and CSS</li>
				<li>Basic and complex javascript functions</li>
				<li>Building a website</li>
				<li>Condense complicated code</li>
				<li>Create and modify phone apps </li>
				<li>Testing my own code</li>
				<li>Learning new skills at a fast pace</li>
				<li>Passion solving puzzles with code</li>
			</ul>
